angular: 

it is a frontend javascript framework for building interactive, modern web user interfaces
it's also a collection of tools and feature like CLI (eg. ng serve, ng serve --open, etc), Debugging tools, IDE plugin\

why use angular instead of using "just javascript"?

for trivial websites and web apps, you would not need angular.But frameworks like Angular do really shine
as your applications become more complex because they simplify the process of building complex, highly interactive web user interfaces.

reason: 
1. you can write declarative code with angular instead of imperative code ( step by step instructions) like Vanilla javascript

components in angular:
you build a component tree. 
one angular application = one component tree

eg:                         app component
								|	|					|
				Header Component     User component 	Tasks component			

components are custom HTML elements

Why components?

1. Modular Applications:
break up complex apps into simple building blocks
split up responsibilities and concerns
build a component once and reuse it often as needed.

2. Better Dev Process
Assign diff team members to diff components
Share components and logic across the team
reduce dependencies


Angular has some OOP concepts & principles

Angular uses TypeScript (not vanilla javascript)

Typescript is a Javascript superset - an extension of JavaScript. It extends JS syntax to support strong and strict typing. Unlike vanilla js, TS enforces types and prevents unexpected value type changes

Easier dev with typescript: 
with TS, you can often catch errors early on during development. 
without TS, those errors would be undetected and then posibly only surface at runtime when application crashes or behaves incorrectly.


Angular team releases -> major releases every 6 months
despite labeled as major releases, these releases do not break your code & " change the framework"

2016 - angular 2 released

2017 - angular 4 released (v3 skipped)

2017 - version 5 releaes

-: - angular 6 - 13 released 

2022 - angular 14 and 15 released: angular 14 introduces "standalone components"

2023 - angular 16 is released. : angular 16 introduces signals

But to follow along with exactly the same setup as shown over the next lectures, you should create new projects via ng new first-angular-app --no-zoneless.

In the next lecture, I just run ng new first-angular-app - but with Angular v21+, this will give you a project that is configured in a "zoneless" mode, a mode we'll explore in detail a little later in the course. Therefore, to get started, I recommend creating projects with the --no-zoneless flag.

latest as per 2026: v21 is the stable version latest


create new angular app: ng new first-angular-app --no-zoneless
start the app: npm start


folder structure:

all the files you find in the top level of your project are configuration files

package files: manage the dependencies of your application.
we will use features from these dependencies in our code

angular.json: contains extra configuration for angular CLI and angular provided tools in general. You dont need to change anything in this files

.editorconfig: contains some rules for the code editorconfig
.gitignore: relevant if you are using gitignore

src folder -> 
app folder: here you will build angular components
naming convention standard: app.component.html, css, ts. 

styles.css file: global styles across all components
index.html: main html file which will be loaded when visitors visit your websites

main.ts : it will be the first code file, to be executed when the angular application loads in the browser of the visitors, i.e. the code of this will be executed first

assets folder: store images to be used

app folder: in this folder you will build and combine all the angular components


npm install: install all those dependencies mentioned in the package.json
need to do it only once


## npm start: under the hood it executes "npm serve"


### HOW IS THE SCREEN LOADED?, I MEAN HOW DOES CONTENT END UP ON OUR SCREEN?

1. the index.html is the file that loads.
2. in this file, you can see in the <body> element, there is this custom <app-root> element, but there is no <script> tag in this file.
3. But when you run the application and do the "page source" on browser, you see some <script> tag with js file imports as below:
	<script src="polyfills.js" type="module"></script><script src="main.js" type="module"></script></body>
4. those are injected into this file automatically by the Angular CLI when you build and run your application
5. That is how the code in this main.ts gets executed after begin compiled into JavaScript code, which is also done by the Angular CLI. That's why in the page source, we find this "main.js" file being imported
6. so its the compiled code of main.ts that gets executed.
7. this code executes the bootstrapApplication() method provided by an angular package, and this method takes an Angular component as input.
	eg: bootstrapApplication(AppComponent).
	AppComponent -> import from ./app/app.component. => now here the .ts is missing from app.component.ts, reason: for importing something from .ts file, we should omit '.ts' extension in the import
8. AppComponent is a class inside the app.component.ts, and it has a decorator @Component(...) attached to it. This decorator adds some metadata to the thing it is attached to (in this case, the AppComponent class)
9. we are importing this decorator from the "core" package of the "angular" framework: import {Component} from '@angular/core';
10. It is this decorator that converts a standard class into such a Angular Component that is treated as a component i.e. a custom HTML element
11. This @Component decorator receives some object having some metadata:
				@Component({
				selector: 'app-root',
				standalone: true,
				imports: [],
				templateUrl: './app.component.html',
				styleUrl: './app.component.css',
				})
				as you can see, @Component takes the object: 
					{
						selector: 'app-root',
						standalone: true,
						imports: [],
						templateUrl: './app.component.html',
						styleUrl: './app.component.css',
					}

12. "selector" property: it tells Angular for which elements to look in the HTML code, so that those elements can be replaced by the component and its markup.
13. The markup of this component is stored in the file whose path is given by this "templateUrl" property
14. "styleUrl": this contains the styles that apply only to the markup of this component. They can't clash with other styles
15. "standalone": true: this property is by default true for Angular versions >= 19. If version is lesser, you need to define it explicitly.
	it means that the component does NOT belong to any NgModule and it manages its own dependencies

After Angular 20: the file naming pattern has changed. Eg. its now only header.ts instead of header.component.ts


@Component({
    selector: 'app-header',
    // template: '<h1>Hello World </h1>' - you can use this for small UI / demos. For more complex ones, use templateUrl: html page
	....
})

 templateUrl: './header.component.html': this "./" means that this file is present in the same folder

 ## standalone: true - it means it is a standalone component and not module based component

 # module based component:
	1. Components are declared inside @NgModule
	2. Modules manage:
		Declarations
		Imports (CommonModule, FormsModule, etc.)
		Exports
	3.AppModule (root module) bootstraps the app

# standalone component:
	1. No module needed
	2. Component manages its own dependencies
	3.Can be:
		Bootstrapped directly
		Lazy loaded
		Used inside other standalone components or modules

# Only if you add this <app-header> inside index.html, it wont work as angular looks for components to run in main.ts
so, in main.ts add like: bootstrapApplication(HeaderComponent); - now angular its aware of it, it finds its tag and renders it

but this is not how you build angular app. The idea is build nested components, app Component will be the root component, others will be inside it. eg:
							        app component
							|	          |				|
				Header Component	User Component    Tasks Component 
														    |
														Task Component	
	
One Angular Appliction = One Component Tree

so the idea is that you call the bootstrapApplication(..) only once, on the root component, and then you use other components inside that root component's template
eg: replace the <header> in the app.component.html with our customer <app-header> tag

Error: app-header is not a known element: it means you have not imported our HeaderComponent inside the app.component.ts's @Component decorator

## styles.css in top level of project: applies styles to all the components
## css files of components: apply only to that particular components

## When using the assets folder to import images, etc, you should make sure that the angular.json file in your root directory has an 
entry as 
"assets": [
	"src/assets"
]
If not, manually add "src/assets" inside the "assets"[] array, also add "src/favicon.ico" to see this as well



### 🧩 Pro tip for your Angular learning repo

Your structure should look like this:

angular-tutorial/
 ├── first-angular-app/
 ├── 01-starting-project/
 ├── angular-notes.txt
 └── .git

 ## I had .git file in first-angular-app as well. But there should be only one .git file and that at the root.
 delete the .git file inside any other directory.
